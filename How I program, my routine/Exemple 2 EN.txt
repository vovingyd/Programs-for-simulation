This is an example of my thoughts when I program a station.
This station taken is from this video https://youtu.be/o5LcnERibTA?t=117

I presume that different stations communicate by availability bits, thus linking all of the simple processes in one automated machine

Sensors:
Gripper right reed switch	-	Grip_Open
Gripper left reed switch	-	Grip_Closed
CylinderX right reed switch	-	CylX_R
CylinderX left reed switch	-	CylX_L
CylinderY upper reed switch	-	CylY_U
CylinderY down reed switch	-	CylY_D

Contactors:
Gripper	- ON/OFF - open/close
CylinderX - ON/OFF - extend/retract
CylinderY - ON/OFF - lower/raise

*System interruptions
when pressing buttons stop or emergency stop
	skip to program part *Station stop
*end of the system interrupts

*Initial conditions
stop lamp is ON
when pressing the reset button
	release gripper so Grip_Open is ON and Grip_Closed is OFF
	raise CylinderY so CylY_U is ON and CylY_D is OFF
	retract CylinderX so CylX_L is ON and CylX_R is OFF
		If these conditions are not met within 3 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

when start button is pressed
	start lamp turns ON
	stop lamp turns OFF
	go to program part *Start of cycle

*Start of cycle

Extend CylinderX so CylX_R is ON and CylX_L is OFF
	if CylX_R is OFF for more than 2 seconds
	Or if any other than CylX_R and CylX_L sensors have changed their state //This prevents diagonal movement e.g. if CylY_U turns off while CylinderX is moving
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

Wait until availability bit from magazine station is ON

IF Grip_OPEN is ON and Grip_Closed is OFF
	lower CylinderY so CylY_D is ON and CylY_U is OFF
		if CylY_D is OFF for more than 2 seconds
		Or if any other than CylY_D and CylY_U sensors have changed their state
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

Close Gripper so Grip_Closed is ON and Grip_Open is OFF
	if Grip_Closed is OFF for more than 2 seconds
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

Raise CylinderY so CylY_U is ON and CylY_D is OFF
	if CylY_U is OFF for more than 2 seconds
	Or if any other than CylY_D and CylY_U sensors have changed their state
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

Retract CylinderX so CylX_R is ON and CylX_L is OFF
	if CylX_R is OFF for more than 2 seconds
	Or if any other than CylX_R and CylX_L sensors have changed their state
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

When until availability bit from rotation table is ON

Lower CylinderY so CylY_D is ON and CylY_U is OFF
	if CylY_D is OFF for more than 2 seconds
	Or if any other than CylY_D and CylY_U sensors have changed their state
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

Release Gripper so Grip_Open is ON and Grip_Closed is OFF
	if Grip_Open is OFF for more than 2 seconds
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

Raise CylinderY so CylY_U is ON and CylY_D is OFF
	if CylY_U is OFF for more than 2 seconds
	Or if any other than CylY_D and CylY_U sensors have changed their state
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

*End of cycle
	go to *Start loop

*Station stop
	turn OFF all drives
	turn OFF the start lamp
	turn ON stop lamp
	go to program part *Initial conditions
