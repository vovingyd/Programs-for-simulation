This is an example of my thoughts when I program the station taken from this video https://youtu.be/tUfQV0gRKYA?t=52

*System interruptions
when pressing buttons stop or emergency stop
	skip to program part *Station stop
*end of the system interrupts

*Initial conditions
stop lamp on
when pressing the reset button
	turn off conveyor
	raise griper until upper reed switch 2 is on
	lower the cylinder until bottom reed switch 1 is on
	
should be off
	upper reed switch 1
	lower reed switch 2
	3 parts presence sensors

If the previous conditions are not met
	display an error message
	skip to program part *Station stop

when start button is pressed
	start lamp turns on
	stop lamp off
	go to program part *Start of cycle

*Start of cycle

turn conveyor on

These are the questions I ask myself when programming a station
What happens if:
	the conveyor stops working or 1 of the part presence sensors does not work?
		if the part presence sensor does is off for more than 5 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop
	the pressure on the cylinder disappears, which means that the lower reed switch 1 will be off?
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop
	will the pressure on the gripper disappear, which means that the upper reed switch 2 will be off?
		display an error message
		skip to program part *Station stop

when 3 sensors for the presence of a part are triggered
	stop conveyor
	lower the griper to the lower reed switch 2
		if the lower reed switch 2 is off for more than 2 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

when the lower reed switch 2 is activated
	Raise the cylinder up to the upper reed switch 1
		if upper reed switch 1 does not operate for more than 2 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

the hand drove up to the station and grabbed 3 parts (since the hand has its own automated cycle, its errors are registered in its own cycle)
	raise the griper to the top reed switch 2
		if the upper reed switch 2 is off for more than 2 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

the hand has moved away from the station (since the hand has its own automated cycle, its errors are registered in its own cycle)
	lower the cylinder to the lower reed switch 1
		if the lower reed switch 1 is off for more than 2 seconds
			display an error message
			skip to program part *Station stop

lower reed switch 1 is on

*End of cycle
	go to *Start loop

*Station stop
	turn off all drives
	turn off the start lamp
	turn on stop lamp
	go to program part *Initial conditions
